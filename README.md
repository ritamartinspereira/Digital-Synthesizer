# Digital-Synthesizer
In this project,  we address two aspects of musical signal processing: the extraction of features from recordings of an instrument or human voice interpreting a musical melody and its reinterpretation by a digital synthesizer.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Signal-Processing-Synthesizer.git

## Project Structure
```
├── File.wav                # Example audio files provided for testing
├── File.mid                # Example MIDI files for synthesis comparison
├── hammer_noise.npy        # Noise of a hammer hitting strings for accurate synthesis
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies for the project
├── synthesizer_project.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook with the implementation
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## 📝 Project Workflow
1. Automatic Onset Detection
2. Pitch and Beat Detection
3. Polyphonic Synthesizer

## Provided Files
Audio Samples:
Example recordings are provided. Feel free to replace them with your own recordings.
MIDI Files:
Example MIDI files are provided in the folder for synthesis quality evaluation.

## ℹ️ Notes
- This project uses manual onset markings for evaluation. If you choose to use custom recordings, ensure you provide human-marked onset timings for comparison, you can use Audacity for example.
